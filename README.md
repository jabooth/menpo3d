menpo3d - Tools for manipulating meshes
=======================================
A library inside the Menpo project that makes manipulating 3D mesh data a 
simple task. In particular, this project provides the ability to import,
visualize and rasterize 3D meshes. Although 3D meshes can be created within
the main Menpo project, this package adds the real functionality for working
with 3D data.

Installation
------------
Here in the Menpo team, we are firm believers in making installation as simple 
as possible. Unfortunately, we are a complex project that relies on satisfying 
a number of complex 3rd party library dependencies. The default Python packing 
environment does not make this an easy task. Therefore, we evangelise the use 
of the conda ecosystem, provided by 
[Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/). In order to make things 
as simple as possible, we suggest that you use conda too! To try and persuade 
you, go to the [Menpo website](http://www.menpo.io/installation/) to find 
installation instructions for all major platforms.
